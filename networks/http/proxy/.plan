# Basic Proxy

## High Level Steps

1. Send the request upstream (see the request on the upstream server)
2. Receive and log the reply from the upstream server
3. Send the reply back to the client


## Request Flow

1. Client opens the TCP connection with proxy (all done with socket syscalls)
2. Client sends HTTP request as bytes
3. Proxy opens a connection with the upstream (eventually this should be persistent?)
4. Proxy sends the HTTP request (add forwarding related header(s)?)
5. Upstream replies the the proxy
6. Proxy replies to the client
